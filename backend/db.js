/*
In MongoDB, documents stored in a collection require a unique _id field that acts as a primary key. 
MongoDB uses ObjectIds as the default value for the _id field if the _id field is not specified; i.e. 
if a document does not contain a top-level _id field, the MongoDB driver adds the _id field that holds 
an ObjectId. In addition, if the mongod receives a document to insert that does not contain an _id field, 
mongod will add the _id field that holds an ObjectId.

In Mongoose, Schema.Types.ObjectId is a special data type used to define a field in a schema that will 
store MongoDB ObjectIDs. MongoDB ObjectIDs are unique identifiers automatically generated by MongoDB 
for each document in a collection.
